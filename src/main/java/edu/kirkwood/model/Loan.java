/**
 * Represents a simple fixed-rate loan with a principal,
 * annual percentage rate (APR), term, and number of payments per term.
 * <p>
 * Usage note: {@link #setAPR(double)} converts a whole-number percent
 * entered by a user (e.g., 6 for 6%) into a decimal stored internally
 * (e.g., 0.06). Methods such as {@link #periodicRate()}, {@link #payment()},
 * {@link #totalPaid()}, and {@link #totalInterest()} operate on that decimal form.
 * <p>
 * Provides methods for getting and setting loan details,
 * as well as basic arithmetic calculations such as total payments
 * and the periodic interest rate.
